**Building Instructions Coming Soon!**

Software
Firmware --- We chose to use Grbl. As it is easy to configure and powerful enough for our need. We suggest using a **[modified version](https://github.com/robottini/grbl-servo)** made by robottini. This version adds support for a servo and is pretty much plug and play. **Here you can see our configuration. Feel free to copy, but change it a little :P ** *Print a few lines in x and y direction in order to calibrate the steps\mm* ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/3WaZSCs.png) Useful Programs --- For generating G-Code from vector files we used this **[awesome plugin](https://jtechphotonics.com/?page_id=2012)** from Jtech Photonics. *Be aware to set the laser power according to how much you want your servo to be lifted* To create G-Code from bitmaps we suggest using this **[wonderfully working plugin](https://github.com/305engineering/Inkscape)** from 305engineering *Be aware to set the laser power according to how much you want your servo to be lifted* **Check out our results! :P** ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/8enl6UZ.jpg)

Design Process --- The design process was quite long and frustrating but the end results is definitely worth it in our opinion! We had to came through 6 prototypes and various iterations in order to first resolve technical issues and then work on the details. We modeled everything on Rhinoceros 5, from scratch. If anyone is interested in the 3dm file let us know so we can share it! **Even tough our first step now is completed we would love to hear your thoughts, suggestion and improvements on the comment section!**
